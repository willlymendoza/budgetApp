# BudgetApp

> This is a budget app made with HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT

> The idea was taken from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_HJ3juuFvo), which is part of the [freecodecamp.org youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_HJ3juuFvo) . I only saw the operation of the application and decided to do it by my self to put into practice the acquired knowledge.
